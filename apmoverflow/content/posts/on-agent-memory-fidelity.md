> tl;dr Context should not be one flat transcript. It should be a structured object of messages, where each message can be *full*, *summarized*, or *hidden*. The agent can tune that detail-level per message per prompt, spending tokens only where needed.

Since Sonnet 3.7 came out last summer, I've barely hand-written code. Coding agents are getting insanely good, and I (like many others) keep trusting these models to do more and more.

With that said, since we’re not writing code line-by-line, our intent becomes more abstract, and we stop critically thinking about the code itself. The chats with Claude show your intent more than the code diffs. However, they can be millions of tokens large, and most intent rarely needs the entire chat loaded into context. So, I started toying with the idea of embedding compression and context infrastructure.

Most of the interesting work in the space happens through [alternative training methods](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.15957) that make embeddings reversibly compressible, but I wanted to see how far a pure harness-engineering approach could go.

## Background

Agents are constrained in how much they can keep in-memory by their context windows, usually within 400K-1M tokens. Once the context window gets past 50%, model behavior degrades because old, irrelevant, stale, or noisy information remains in the prompt. This is called [context rot](https://www.trychroma.com/research/context-rot). There's 2 main ways for context to rot in coding agents: (1) irrelevant chats and information are included in the prompt, or (2) unnecessarily long, sparse messages.

I argue for a few different threads.

![On Agent Memory Fidelity (Decant) 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/islamtayeb/obsidian-files/main/On Agent Memory Fidelity (Decant)-1.png)
*The three framings side by side. Cleanup fires only at the compaction threshold in (1) but every turn in (2) and (3). Only (3) is reversible.*

### Context as a constant

Agentic coding tools periodically "compact" chat history when you're about to fill up your context window. However, if a prompt requires only 1 message out of a chat with 5 messages, you’ll still pay for those 5 messages until you hit that compaction point. On top of that, during compaction, details can be lost without any reversible way of getting those full messages back.

### Context as a string variable

The agent can now treat context as a variable to edit whenever it deems fit. Old work can be cut if unnecessary. So, we can make an agent that can read, grep, and bash over its own context to edit it, similar to a simplified [recursive language model](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/#:~:text=We%20propose%20Recursive%20Language%20Models%2C%20or,the%20user%E2%80%99s%20prompt%20in%20a%20variable) (RLM). We'll call this an RGB-agent[^1]. However, it still has to re-ingest a large portion of the context to know what to edit

### Context as message objects

Rather than treating context as a long string, we can view it as a structured object of `Message` objects. Each `Message` contains data (timeSent, content, etc.). Adding a “compression” field to `Message` could theoretically let an agent consider a summary (or drop) of obviously-irrelevant context without having to re-ingest the full session.

Obviously, there is no "compression" parameter on GPT or Claude, so we'll settle for discrete fidelity[^5] settings, namely full / summary / hidden.

This is how conversations work for humans. I do not remember every detail of a conversation (even mid-conversation). Some key parts stay vivid, some collapse into a gist, and tangents might disappear.

Agent sessions should have the same *adaptive forgetting*. Where it differs from humans: when detail matters again, the agent should be able to fetch the message in full.

## Decant: Context as Message Objects w/ Compression

**Decant allows agents to treat context as a collection of message objects grouped into topics, with knobs to adjust compression.** The agent decides how much of each topic or message should stay in the next prompt.

There are two control layers:

1. **Topic**: multiple messages that describe the same thread of work. A topic can be rendered as full / summary / hidden.
2. **Message**: the building block of a topic. A single message can inherit the topic setting, or force itself back to full / summary / hidden.

The agent does not have to reread the whole transcript. It starts from the topic map, lowers the fidelity of stale topics, looks at message summaries, then fetches exact messages later if the summary is not enough.

To be concrete, Decant's context map looks roughly like this:

```python
class Topic:
    topic_id: str
    summary: str                # stand-in when the topic renders cheaply
    messages: list[Message]     # lets exact messages be reopened later
    token_estimate: int         # flags big topics before they eat the prompt
    fidelity: "full" | "summary" | "hidden"

class Message:
    parts: list[Part]           # raw message data (text, reasoning, tools)
    topic_id: Optional[str] = None
    summary: str
    token_estimate: int
    fidelity: "inherit" | "full" | "summary" | "hidden"
```

The important additions are `fidelity`, `topicID`, and `summary`: what gets rendered, where the message belongs, and what replaces the full text when Decant needs a cheaper view.

The raw message data still exists, making it reversibly compressible. The prompt just gets a cheaper view by default and could at any moment use a tool call `message_detail` to "zoom in" to a message when needed.

### Fidelity Engine

Decant annotates the conversation as it happens. On each assistant turn, it asks the model to return the normal answer plus a hidden `<annotation>` tag for the user's latest prompt and the message output, something like:

```json
// ...Actual message...
// <annotation>
{
	"topic": "stable snake_case topic label for this assistant response",
	"is_new_topic": "boolean: whether this response starts a new topic",
	"message_summary": "summary of this assistant message only",
    "placeholder": "short 5-10 word stub for the topic as description",
    "key_facts": [
	    "facts or decisions worth preserving through compression"
    ]
}
// </annotation>
```

Decant strips that annotation from the visible chat and stores it next to the session.

That gives the next prompt a menu of renderings. Recent work can stay full. Finished work can become message summaries. Distant work can become topic summaries. Old dead ends can become placeholders or disappear.

The annotation is usually on the order of 300-500 output tokens. You're accepting to pay a consistent, small "tax" to allow the agent the ability to bookkeep and visualize the chat. The agent can call `view_context` and `set_fidelity` to change the map before the next turn.

During OpenCode compaction, Decant also rewrites the compaction prompt so the summarizer respects those annotations instead of flattening every old turn equally. It can use `set_fidelity` to hide or shrink unimportant context.

### Updated Git Blame

As agents write more code, they take care of edge cases and implement specifications without the user noticing. However, knowing *why* a piece of code was written in a large codebase with 100s of engineers is important. The user's intention is just as important as the code output, especially when the code isn’t optimized for human readability.

Here is one possible workflow with a `blame_lookup()` tool call that I’d like to explore:

1. Agent runs tool call over a line reference
2. Run git blame on the line, get commit hash
3. Check Agent Session <> Commit mapping, get session ID
4. Spawn sub-agent on session with original question about intent + topics in the session
5. View message summaries of selected topics, zoom into specific messages as necessary

![On Agent Memory Fidelity (Decant) 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/islamtayeb/obsidian-files/main/On Agent Memory Fidelity (Decant)-2.png)
*git blame to the commit, the commit to the session that produced it, then a sub-agent recovers why the line exists and cites the message it came from.*

Now you've allowed agents to make use of other agents' transcripts, and created an efficient way for them to search for what they need with the fidelity engine. Pretty cool.

Specifically for the "Agent Session <> Commit mapping", Decant checks if you have git-ai installed to see if there's an existing mapping. It also keeps a hidden project-local backup.

### User Control

Decant exposes the context map to the dev for transparency and manual control. You can see what the model is likely to read, how large each topic is, and what has been collapsed or hidden.

The sidebar and /context show the conversation grouped by topic. Each topic has a token estimate and a fidelity setting. From /context, you can set a topic to full / summary / hidden. You can also override individual messages' fidelity.

/blame is a manual trigger over the aforementioned `blame_lookup` tool call. You could enter a line reference, or ask a natural-language question about past chats. Decant runs `blame_lookup` as we discussed in the last section, finds the relevant prior session, and answers why a line is present given past conversations about it.

## Evaluation

I wanted to test whether Decant actually changes the shape of agent memory. Old conversations should not sit in every future prompt just because they happened earlier. But they also cannot disappear, because later tasks may need an exact old fact or the reason behind a line of code.

I tested that in three ways.

* The first eval asks whether old facts can be recovered after the old session has been compressed.
* The second asks what happens when unrelated future work piles up.
* The third starts from code: given a line reference, can Decant route back to the session/message that explains it?

All of this is small and hand-built. The point is to check the memory routes, not to claim Decant makes agents better programmers per se. That'd require more rigorous benchmarks with harder problems.

I use three methods throughout the evals.

| Method | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| Default compaction | Carries a compacted summary of the old transcript. Default behavior of OpenCode. |
| RGB-agent | Keeps old chat outside the prompt, then uses read, grep, and bash before answering.[^2] |
| Decant | Keeps old detail outside the prompt, then opens exact messages only when needed. |

### Selective Memory Under Future Work

I started with 8 old topics, then asked 4 exact recall questions and 48 unrelated current-work questions. I ran the RGB-agent version three times with openai/gpt-5.5; default and Decant are the saved blog runs for the same shape.

Default compaction recovered 3 of 12 old facts. RGB-agent and Decant recovered all 12. RGB-agent also stopped carrying old memory into current-work prompts. Decant was still cheaper because its lookup opens narrower evidence than raw transcript search.

| Condition          | Runs Passed | Old-Fact Recall | Current Work | Avg Query Tokens | Avg Total Cost[^3] |
| :----------------- | ----------: | --------------: | -----------: | ---------------: | -----------------: |
| Default compaction |         0/3 |            3/12 |      144/144 |             320K |          $0.79 (–) |
| RGB-agent          |         3/3 |           12/12 |      144/144 |             305K |       $0.80 (+1%) |
| Decant             |         3/3 |           12/12 |      144/144 |             277K |       $0.62 (-22%) |

### Fanout

The old-memory demand stays fixed at 4 recall questions. The unrelated work grows from 24 to 96 future turns. RGB-agent keeps old memory out of current-work prompts, but recall turns still search the raw transcript. Decant uses fewer query tokens because lookup returns a smaller old-memory slice.

| Condition | 24 Turns | 48 Turns | 96 Turns |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| RGB-agent | $2.83 | $3.10 | $3.39 |
| Decant | $1.52 (-46%) | $1.74 (-44%) | $2.36 (-30%) |

### Updated Git Blame Lookup

Given a line reference, Decant follows blame to a commit, maps that commit to an agent session, then opens the topic/message that explains the line.

```text
line reference -> git blame commit -> agent session -> topic/message -> rationale
```

The past chats here are Codex-generated eval fixtures. The repos are tiny, the commits are seeded, and the decoy sessions are known ahead of time. This is not evidence that Decant handles a messy real codebase yet. It checks whether the blame-to-chat route works when the evidence exists.

A post-hoc GPT-5.5 judge scored the five standard blame answers from 0 to 1.[^4] For default, this table assumes the full old fixture context is charged on each question, as it would normally. Obviously, compaction would take place in "chunks" of 1M tokens if the chat was >1M tokens long.

| Condition          | Judge Score | Avg Query Tokens | Avg Total Cost[^3] |
| :----------------- | ----------: | ---------------: | -----------------: |
| Default compaction |        0.93 |             190K |          $0.29 (–) |
| RGB-agent          |        0.91 |              53K |       $0.10 (-65%) |
| Decant             |        0.93 |              44K |       $0.05 (-83%) |

## Afterword

None of the evals show Decant makes agents better programmers, partially because I'm too lazy to make a full benchmark. But it shows the potential infra gains, and memory routes work when the evidence exists in the blame eval. Testing how this works out in actual production environments with big teams would be an interesting future direction though.

Also, the discrete full / summary / hidden knobs are placeholders for a continuous and learned `compression` field. [R3Mem](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.15957) trains embeddings to be reversibly compressible.

Alas, I've enjoyed thinking about agents for the last couple of months. I've been thinking a lot about "compilers" for different fields and how transformers fundamentally work to enable funny improvements like [copy-pasting the prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14982) and [asking for reasoning before score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442).

[^2]: In these evals, RGB-agent means the old chat stays outside the prompt, each question gets an editable working context, and the answer turn can use read, grep, and bash against that context before replying.

[^3]: Estimated cost uses a fixed GPT-5.5 standard price model as of 2026-05-17: `input_tokens * $5/M + cache_read_tokens * $0.50/M + (output_tokens + reasoning_tokens) * $30/M`. Tool/runtime costs are not included. For non-GPT runs, treat this as a normalized estimate, not the provider bill.

[^4]: Judge scores are post-hoc semantic scores over saved artifacts, not the original benchmark pass/fail bit. I used openai/gpt-5.5 as the judge. For blame lookup, the judge saw the question, expected rationale facts, forbidden distractor terms, final answer, and expected session/message citation.

[^5]: How much of a message actually reaches the prompt. Similar to image fidelity: high fidelity, high resolution (and vice versa).
